## building blocks

-> users

-> groups

-> roles

## best practices

* users inherit permissions from groups
* permissions at group level
* one user equals one physical person -> no multishare single account
* least privilege

> set password policy

> whenever user created, he has no permissions by default

> active directory -> federation -> SSO -> same username and password as login. using SAML

> access key ID and secret access key are for prorammatic access. Not same as username and password

> password rotation

> you only get to view the credentials once
